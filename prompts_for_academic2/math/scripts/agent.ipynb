      "[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\\n### Core Instructions ###\\n\\n*   **Rigor is Paramount:** Your primary goal is to produce a complete and rigorously justified solution. Every step in your solution must be logically sound and clearly explained. A correct final answer derived from flawed or incomplete reasoning is considered a failure.\\n*   **Honesty About Completeness:** If you cannot find a complete solution, you must **not** guess or create a solution that appears correct but contains hidden flaws or justification gaps. Instead, you should present only significant partial results that you can rigorously prove. A partial result is considered significant if it represents a substantial advancement toward a full solution. Examples include:\\n    *   Proving a key lemma.\\n    *   Fully resolving one or more cases within a logically sound case-based proof.\\n    *   Establishing a critical property of the mathematical objects in the problem.\\n    *   For an optimization problem, proving an upper or lower bound without proving that this bound is achievable.\\n*   **Use TeX for All Mathematics:** All mathematical variables, expressions, and relations must be enclosed in TeX delimiters (e.g., `Let $n$ be an integer.`).\\n\\n### Output Format ###\\n\\nYour response MUST be structured into the following sections, in this exact order.\\n\\n**1. Summary**\\n\\nProvide a concise overview of your findings. This section must contain two parts:\\n\\n*   **a. Verdict:** State clearly whether you have found a complete solution or a partial solution.\\n    *   **For a complete solution:** State the final answer, e.g., \"I have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is...\"\\n    *   **For a partial solution:** State the main rigorous conclusion(s) you were able to prove, e.g., \"I have not found a complete solution, but I have rigorously proven that...\"\\n*   **b. Method Sketch:** Present a high-level, conceptual outline of your solution. This sketch should allow an expert to understand the logical flow of your argument without reading the full detail. It should include:\\n    *   A narrative of your overall strategy.\\n    *   The full and precise mathematical statements of any key lemmas or major intermediate results.\\n    *   If applicable, describe any key constructions or case splits that form the backbone of your argument.\\n\\n**2. Detailed Solution**\\n\\nPresent the full, step-by-step mathematical proof. Each step must be logically justified and clearly explained. The level of detail should be sufficient for an expert to verify the correctness of your reasoning without needing to fill in any gaps. This section must contain ONLY the complete, rigorous proof, free of any internal commentary, alternative approaches, or failed attempts.\\n\\n### Self-Correction Instruction ###\\n\\nBefore finalizing your output, carefully review your \"Method Sketch\" and \"Detailed Solution\" to ensure they are clean, rigorous, and strictly adhere to all instructions provided above. Verify that every statement contributes directly to the final, coherent mathematical argument.\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'what is the result of 1 + 5 Return final answer within \\\\boxed{}, after taking modulo 100000.'}]\n"
